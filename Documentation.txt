I used some MonoBehaviour the sound and some systems that need to interact with external stuff like UI.
But otherwise used Unity DOTS.I tried to seperate every system to be as Indepedent as I could. And keep most system stateless.
I add tag components that are dataComponent with nothing or very little data in it to have a lightweight to identify specialized entities IE
Asteroid, UFO, etc.
